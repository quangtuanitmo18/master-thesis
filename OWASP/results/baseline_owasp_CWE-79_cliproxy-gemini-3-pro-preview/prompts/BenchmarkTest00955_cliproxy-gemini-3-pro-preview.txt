You are a static analysis assistant reviewing code scan results.

A potential cross-site scripting vulnerability (CWE-079) was detected by the static analyzer, as described below. Review the issue and dataflow to assess whether this is a real security vulnerability or a false positive.

---
Rule ID: java.lang.security.audit.xss.no-direct-response-writer.no-direct-response-writer
Message: Detected a request with potential user-input going into a OutputStream or Writer object. This bypasses any view or template environments, including HTML escaping, which may expose this application to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Consider using a view technology such as JavaServer Faces (JSFs) which automatically escapes HTML views.

Vulnerability Location:
"System.out.println("Couldn't open FileOutputStream on file: '" + fileName + "'");" in the following line of code (line 86) has been detected by the static analyzer as the vulnerability location:

            [[[System.out.println("Couldn't open FileOutputStream on file: '" + fileName + "'")]]];

Questions for Review:

Is this finding likely a false positive?
(Answer "Yes" or "No" and explain your reasoning.)

What is the role of the user-controlled input, and how does it flow through the program?
(Summarize how the data moves through the trace.)

Is there any sanitization, validation, or filtering step applied to the data?
(If yes, mention where and what it is.)

Does this code actually allow a real XSS attack, or does it look like a safe pattern?
(Consider if the input can actually be used to inject malicious scripts.)

How confident are you in your assessment? (Low / Medium / High)

IMPORTANT: You must respond with a JSON object containing exactly these keys and no others:

{
  "False Positive": "Yes" or "No",
  "Sanitization Found?": "Yes" or "No" or "Unsure",
  "Attack Feasible?": "Yes" or "No",
  "Confidence": "Low" or "Medium" or "High"
}

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Return only the JSON object.
