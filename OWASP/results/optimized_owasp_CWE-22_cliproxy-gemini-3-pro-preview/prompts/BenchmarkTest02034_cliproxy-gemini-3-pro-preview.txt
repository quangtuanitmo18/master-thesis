System role:
You are a security analyst adjudicating static analysis alerts for CWE-022 (Path Traversal).
Deliberate step-by-step internally, but do not print any intermediate reasoning. Return only the required JSON.

Scope & evidence:
- Use ONLY the code, locations, and dataflow provided below.
- Do not assume behavior of code that is not shown (e.g., filesystem/proxy configs).
- Base your decision strictly on the provided snippet and trace.

Rubric (CWE-022 micro-rules):
- Path traversal occurs when untrusted input influences filesystem paths so an attacker can access files outside an intended directory or target unexpected locations.
- High risk (likely NOT a false positive):
  - Concatenating user input into paths for read/write/delete/list/extract without robust normalization and restriction.
  - Accepting absolute paths or traversal sequences: "../", "..\", leading "/", drive letters like "C:\", UNC paths "\\", tilde "~/" or env-expansion patterns.
  - Archive extraction using entry names directly (Zip Slip) to write files relative to a base directory.
  - TOCTOU/symlink issues: checks (exists/isDirectory) before open without canonical path verification; following symlinks unintentionally.
- Safer patterns (often a false positive):
  - Resolve against a fixed base directory and **normalize + canonicalize**, then enforce prefix:
    - e.g., `Path target = base.resolve(user).normalize();` then ensure `target.startsWith(base)` (or canonical path prefix check).
  - Reject absolute paths and any traversal after normalization; decode URL-encoded input **before** validation.
  - Use strict allowlists or ID→filename mapping (no free-form paths); fixed filenames; APIs that avoid filesystem writes entirely.
  - Symlink-safe operations (e.g., `toRealPath(LinkOption.NOFOLLOW_LINKS)` with prefix check) and writing with secure temp dirs.
- Not sanitizers / insufficient alone:
  - Simple string replace of "../" or only checking `!path.contains("..")`; extension checks only; regex that misses backslashes or double-encoding; client-side checks; `File.exists()`/`isDirectory()` without canonical prefix enforcement.
- Context notes:
  - Validate **after** decoding (URL/percent, UTF-8 normalization) and **before** use.
  - For Windows, consider both separators and drive/UNC paths; for archives, validate each entry path separately.
  - Authorization by path naming alone is fragile; prefer server-side mapping.

Interpretation of fields for this CWE:
- “Sanitization Found?” = robust normalization/canonicalization with base-path prefix enforcement, strict allowlists, and symlink-safe handling evident in the snippet.
- “Attack Feasible?” = given the shown code, could an attacker reach outside the intended directory or target unintended files (including via archives/symlinks)?

Internal reasoning checklist (do NOT include your notes in the output):
1) Identify the untrusted source and how it forms the filesystem path (concat, resolve, archive entry).
2) Determine whether normalization/canonicalization and a base-path prefix check are applied **after decoding** and **before** use.
3) Check rejection of absolute paths, traversal sequences, backslashes, drive/UNC paths; consider double-encoding.
4) Consider symlink/TOCTOU risks and archive extraction (Zip Slip) patterns.
5) Decide if traversal is feasible; set confidence based on visible evidence.
6) Produce the JSON verdict with appropriate confidence.

--------------------------------
Case to adjudicate (filled from CodeQL)
--------------------------------
A potential path traversal vulnerability (CWE-022) was detected by the static analyzer, as described below. Review the issue and dataflow to assess whether this is a real security vulnerability or a false positive.

---
Rule ID: java.lang.security.httpservlet-path-traversal.httpservlet-path-traversal
Message: Detected a potential path traversal. A malicious actor could control the location of this file, to include going backwards in the directory with '../'. To address this, ensure that user-controlled variables in file paths are sanitized. You may also consider using a utility method such as org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils.getName(...) to only retrieve the file name from the path.
