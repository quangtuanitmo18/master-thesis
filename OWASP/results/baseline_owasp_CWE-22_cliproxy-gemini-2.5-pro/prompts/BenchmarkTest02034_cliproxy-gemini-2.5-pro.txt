You are a static analysis assistant reviewing code scan results.

A potential path traversal vulnerability (CWE-022) was detected by the static analyzer, as described below. Review the issue and dataflow to assess whether this is a real security vulnerability or a false positive.

---
Rule ID: java.lang.security.httpservlet-path-traversal.httpservlet-path-traversal
Message: Detected a potential path traversal. A malicious actor could control the location of this file, to include going backwards in the directory with '../'. To address this, ensure that user-controlled variables in file paths are sanitized. You may also consider using a utility method such as org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils.getName(...) to only retrieve the file name from the path.

Vulnerable Code Snippet:

        // Note: Don't actually do this because this method signature could cause a tool to find
        // THIS file constructor
        // as a vuln, rather than the File signature we are trying to actually test.

Questions for Review:

Is this finding likely a false positive?
(Answer "Yes" or "No" and explain your reasoning.)

What is the role of the user-controlled input, and how does it flow through the program?
(Summarize how the data moves through the trace.)

Is there any sanitization, validation, or filtering step applied to the data?
(If yes, mention where and what it is.)

Does this code actually allow a real path traversal attack, or does it look like a safe pattern?
(Consider if the input can actually be used to access files outside the intended directory.)

How confident are you in your assessment? (Low / Medium / High)

IMPORTANT: You must respond with a JSON object containing exactly these keys and no others:

{
  "False Positive": "Yes" or "No",
  "Sanitization Found?": "Yes" or "No" or "Unsure",
  "Attack Feasible?": "Yes" or "No",
  "Confidence": "Low" or "Medium" or "High"
}

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Return only the JSON object.
