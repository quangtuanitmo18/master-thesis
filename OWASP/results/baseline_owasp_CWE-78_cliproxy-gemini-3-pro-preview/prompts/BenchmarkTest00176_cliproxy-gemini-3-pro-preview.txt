You are a static analysis assistant reviewing code scan results.

A potential OS command injection vulnerability (CWE-078) was detected by the static analyzer, as described below. Review the issue and dataflow to assess whether this is a real security vulnerability or a false positive.

---
Rule ID: java.lang.security.audit.tainted-cmd-from-http-request.tainted-cmd-from-http-request
Message: Detected input from a HTTPServletRequest going into a 'ProcessBuilder' or 'exec' command. This could lead to command injection if variables passed into the exec commands are not properly sanitized. Instead, avoid using these OS commands with user-supplied input, or, if you must use these commands, use a whitelist of specific values.

Questions for Review:

Is this finding likely a false positive?
(Answer "Yes" or "No" and explain your reasoning.)

What is the role of the user-controlled input, and how does it flow through the program?
(Summarize how the data moves through the trace.)

Is there any sanitization, validation, or filtering step applied to the data?
(If yes, mention where and what it is.)

Does this code actually allow a real command injection attack, or does it look like a safe pattern?
(Consider if the input can actually be used to execute arbitrary commands.)

How confident are you in your assessment? (Low / Medium / High)

IMPORTANT: You must respond with a JSON object containing exactly these keys and no others:

{
  "False Positive": "Yes" or "No",
  "Sanitization Found?": "Yes" or "No" or "Unsure",
  "Attack Feasible?": "Yes" or "No",
  "Confidence": "Low" or "Medium" or "High"
}

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Return only the JSON object.
