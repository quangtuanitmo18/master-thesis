Step-by-step reasoning:
1.  **Analyze Source:** The input comes from `request.getQueryString()` which is user-controlled and untrusted. The data flows into the variable `fileName`.
2.  **Analyze Sink (Finding 1):** The first finding flags `System.out.println("Couldn't open FileOutputStream on file: '" + fileName + "'");` at line 85.
    *   **Context:** `System.out.println` writes to the server's standard output (console/logs), not the HTTP response stream sent to the user's browser.
    *   **Vulnerability:** While writing untrusted data to logs can lead to Log Forging (CWE-117), it does not constitute Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), which requires the execution of malicious scripts in a web browser.
3.  **Analyze Sink (Finding 2):** The second finding flags `fos.close()` at line 90, tracking the `fos` object created with `fileName`.
    *   **Context:** `fos` is a `FileOutputStream` used for server-side file operations.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Closing a file stream (or opening one) is a server-side operation. It does not reflect data back to the browser. While creating a file based on user input might be an Arbitrary File Write or Path Traversal risk, it is not XSS.
4.  **Review HTTP Response Handling:** The only part of the code that writes to the HTTP response (`response.getWriter()`) is at line 82: `response.getWriter().println(..., ESAPI.encoder().encodeForHTML(fileName));`.
    *   **Safety:** This output is explicitly encoded using OWASP ESAPI for HTML contexts, rendering it safe from XSS.
5.  **Conclusion:** The static analysis tool has incorrectly identified server-side logging and file resource management as XSS sinks. The actual web output is properly sanitized.
