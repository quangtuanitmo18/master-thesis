You are a static analysis assistant reviewing code scan results.

A potential trust boundary violation vulnerability (CWE-501) was detected by the static analyzer, as described below. Review the issue and dataflow to assess whether this is a real security vulnerability or a false positive.

---
Rule ID: java.lang.security.audit.tainted-session-from-http-request.tainted-session-from-http-request
Message: Detected input from a HTTPServletRequest going into a session command, like `setAttribute`. User input into such a command could lead to an attacker inputting malicious code into your session parameters, blurring the line between what's trusted and untrusted, and therefore leading to a trust boundary violation. This could lead to programmers trusting unvalidated data. Instead, thoroughly sanitize user input before passing it into such function calls.

Vulnerability Location:
"bar)" in the following line of code (line 64) has been detected by the static analyzer as the vulnerability location:

        request.getSession().putValue("userid", [[[bar]]]);

Questions for Review:

Is this finding likely a false positive?
(Answer "Yes" or "No" and explain your reasoning.)

What is the role of the user-controlled input, and how does it flow through the program?
(Summarize how the data moves through the trace.)

Is there any sanitization, validation, or filtering step applied to the data?
(If yes, mention where and what it is.)

Does this code actually allow a real trust boundary violation, or does it look like a safe pattern?
(Consider if the code improperly allows untrusted data to cross a security boundary.)

How confident are you in your assessment? (Low / Medium / High)

IMPORTANT: You must respond with a JSON object containing exactly these keys and no others:

{
  "False Positive": "Yes" or "No",
  "Sanitization Found?": "Yes" or "No" or "Unsure",
  "Attack Feasible?": "Yes" or "No",
  "Confidence": "Low" or "Medium" or "High"
}

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Return only the JSON object.
